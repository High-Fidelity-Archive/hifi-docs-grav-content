## Overview
Before you can use a custom avatar, you must first host its FST and FBX files in a place that is publicly accessible to High Fidelity.  You can use any cloud platforms including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure, Dropbox, etc. If you don't have any other place to host it, you can host your avatar for free on the Marketplace even if you do not intend to sell your avatar to others.

To host your avatar on the Marketplace, use the [Avatar Packager](../create-and-explore/avatars/create-avatars#package-your-avatar-in-high-fidelity), so that it can be used in High Fidelity.
